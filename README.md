#### Adding gpses to a folder
Write `<Folder>` at the beginning of the description, followed by the desired folder name, followed by a `</Folder>` tag.
The folder name must be between 1 and 32 characters long and may not contain ":" or any newline characters (\r and \n)

This plugin may not be compatible with other mods or plugins that modify gps descriptions.

Incompatible plugins/mods (non-exhaustive):  
GPS Distance Helper (https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1223617082) and all forks of the mod.

## Usage:

#### Folder Name
Edit the "Folder Name" textbox to set the folder.  
Changing the tag in the description will work, but is not recommended.

#### Sharing Gpses
You can copy and share a whole folder with another person if both of you are using the plugin. The plulgin automatically adds the folder name as part of the copied string.

Example GPS String:  
`GPS:Home:10000:5000:15000:#FFFFFF:My Folder:`
